### About SPICEIFYüí°:
Indonesia's rempah-rempah (spices) are the fragrant foundation of its world-renowned cuisine. As of May 2024, the nation's spice exports have reached a remarkable US$1.4 billion, a significant 12.5% increase compared to the previous year. This fragrant journey through time showcases Indonesia's enduring role as a key player in the global spice trade.Yet, identifying these spices can be a challenge due to their similar appearances. This confusion can limit exploration and appreciation of this rich culinary heritage.

Current methods of identifying rempah-rempah often rely on visual inspection, leading to misidentification and missed culinary opportunities. Inaccurate spice use can result in unintended flavors or even health risks.We propose a mobile app that leverages machine learning for object detection. Users simply point their smartphone camera at an unknown spice, and the app reveals its identity.  Following identification, the app unlocks a treasure trove of information, including origin, properties, health benefits, and traditional Indonesian culinary uses. To further inspire exploration, the app offers curated recipes featuring the identified spice.

### How did our team come up with this project?üí≠
Our team's drive for this project is rooted in our collective experiences, shared passion for culinary exploration, and recognition of market demand. Personal challenges in identifying and utilizing Indonesian spices sparked the initial idea, fueled by our desire to deepen our understanding of our rich culinary heritage. Seeing a gap in the market for a comprehensive spice identification solution, we envisioned leveraging cutting-edge technology such as machine learning and AI to simplify spice recognition and enhance culinary experiences. Moreover, the potential social impact of promoting Indonesian spices and facilitating culinary exploration further motivated us to embark on this journey.
